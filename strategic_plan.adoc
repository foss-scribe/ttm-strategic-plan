//== Executive Summary

//#TBC#




== Business Plan Purpose

=== Why this plan was developed
This plan has been developed as the successor of the previous Transition Towns Maroondah (TTM) Strategic Plan which detailed our vision, mission and goals for 2012 to 2016.
This current plan aims to provide a new operating vision, operating framework and action plan for 2016 to 2018.

In contrast to the previous plan, which was developed prior to our incorporation, this Plan has been prepared in line with formal business planning methodologies to ensure TTM is better able to encapsulate both what we want to achieve and provide a more structured framework for working with the Maroondah community, businesses and Council.

=== How this plan was developed
This plan began life during an initial consultation with Phil Medley and Dale Bristow of the Maroondah City Council who provided guidance on strategic planning and an insight into Council attitudes towards Sustainability and TTM as a community organisation.

Following this, the Plan was developed in collaboration by the TTM Core Group (See <<Organisational Context>>).

In May 2016, the plan was released under a Creative Commons Licence and development moved to https://github.com/foss-scribe/ttm-strategic-plan[GitHub].

The Plan was authorised and ratified by current President, Pamela French on 3/10/2016.

=== The scope and parameters of this plan
This plan seeks to define the strategic context and action for Transition Towns Maroondah for 2016 to 2018.

In <<Strategic Context>>, we describe our vision, mission and values.

In <<Organisational Context>>, we define TTM’s role in achieving our vision and the outcomes we want to achieve during the lifetime of this plan.

In <<Environmental Context and Analysis>>, we have conducted a detailed study of the key factors that influence our ability to meet our outcomes. We identify our stakeholders and critically analyse our strengths and weaknesses as an organisation as well the identify opportunities and threats.

Finally, in <<Strategic Framework>>, we have developed an action plan that defines how we will work towards our goals for the period and the measures by which our progress will be measured.

=== The Outcomes That Are We Seeking to Achieve
In 2016-2018 TTM will focus on the following areas. Refer to our <<Action Plan>> for further details.

==== Ringwood East – a sustainable pilot model
TTM is working with the Maroondah City Council to develop the Ringwood East activity area as a model of resilience, sustainability and environmental excellence which could be replicated in other areas of Maroondah.

==== Community and Member Participation
TTM is seeking greater participation from our members and the wider community in local events, projects and advocacy activities by individuals, businesses and schools.

==== Align community expectations with COP21
TTM strongly believes that reducing our reliance on carbon-based fuels is imperative to the long-term well being and prosperity of our community and the world in which we live. As such, our goal is to align community, business and Council expectations with the targets set out in the COP21 United Nations Climate Change Conference in December 2015.

==== Sustainable Transport
TTM aims to get more people engaged in cycling, walking and using public transport.

==== Expanded Projects
TTM wishes to see our existing projects continue to grow and prosper. We want to encourage and inspire people to plan and deliver more projects that benefit the community and meet our objectives.

=== Our achievements
TTM has achieved considerable success in the local community in recent years with initiatives including:

* https://croydonfoodswap.wordpress.com[Outer Eastern Permaculture Swap] (_formerly Croydon Food Swap_). This Food Swap intuitive began in Croydon and now has branches in Mooroolbark and Wonga Park
* Creation of a local http://groundtoground.org/[Ground to Ground] initiative
* Annual Earth Hour event planning and hosting in collaboration with Maroondah City Council
* http://ttm.org.au[TTM website]
* Several successful social media campaigns
* Supported participation in Ride to School days and Ride to Work days
* Advocated for sustainable transport
* Formed a Ringwood East Garden Group
* Involvement in a Community Housing Group
* Assisted with tree plantings and preservation of native bushland
* Facilitated monthly gatherings with films, guest speakers and shared meals for Maroondah residents
* Held a regular stall in the sustainability area of the Maroondah Festival
* Presented Composting, Reskilling and Waste workshops
* Involvement in Sustainability Education in relation to the Transition Towns Initiatives and broader Transition Towns Network
* Participated in the 2040 Maroondah Vision
* Helped Solar Information Forum promoting the value of solar power
* Organised Street Parties
* Participated in Forums on Education, Food Security, Energy Management
* Played a notable role in the evolution of the Ringwood East Structure Plan
* Involvement with discussions organised by the Council re development of the Maroondah Housing Strategy

These successes have helped to establish TTM as a well-respected local organisation. Moreover, they have provided us with a platform from which we can engage with the community on new initiatives planned for this period.

=== Our Response to the SWOT Analysis

Our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats were determined by classic SWOT analysis conducted by the Core Group under the facilitation of Phil Medley and Dale Bristow, of the Maroondah City Council.

Our approach was then as individuals to rank six of each in order of importance. These results were then combined to determine which items were most important to the group, as shown below. We then determined activities we can conduct to address each.

Strengths and weaknesses are internalities and therefore directly controllable by the TTM Core Group. Opportunities and threats are externalities and therefore not directly controllable by the TTM Core Group but nevertheless can have an impact on our success or failure in meeting our goals.

=== Action Plan

In this section we describe the major actions we will take. They have been developed from our list of goals for the 2016-2018 period and, where possible aligned to the activities developed as part of our SWOT analysis.

It is important to note that these actions are work-in-progress and many will evolve into separate projects under the stewardship of TTM and their respective project times.


==== Ringwood East – a sustainable pilot model

|====
| Action | Description	| Role	| Performance Measure


| Improve marketing and communications for Ringwood East Project.
| Ringwood East project needs to improve the way the project is marketed to residents, the wider Maroondah community and local businesses.
| TTM will petition Council to create or appoint a position of _Marketing and Communications Coordinator_ for this important community project.
| Council to employ person for project in a part- or full-time capacity


|====


==== Membership, engaging and leveraging

|====
| Action | Description	| Role	| Performance Measure

| Create Core Group Officership for Communications
| Communication is vital to maintaining and growing a community and our current approach is ad hoc and inconsistent and lacks clear voice and message.
| The Core Group will appoint a Communications Manager charged with marketing and publicity across print, web and social media. They will be responsible for creating and executing a communication strategy delivered as a _Communications Management Plan_ for members and stakeholders.
|

Core Group appoints suitable candidate.

Candidate develops working _Communication Management Plan_

| Skills audit
| Conduct a survey of skills among TTM members
| TTM will develop this as a project, leveraging the website and social media
|
Develop, test and deliver needed software.

Successfully receive 50 survey results

| Membership incentives
| Currently there are no incentives to joining TTM as a paying member beyond the right to vote for TTM Officer Bearers during the AGM. This is severely impacting on potential revenue which is having a follow on effect with the ability to pay for PL insurance, domain name renewal and to finance projects.
| TTM will appoint a membership and recruitment manager who will be appointed with the task of creating incentives to encourage members to join and join at the paying tier.
| Attractive incentives advertised and monitored on the Membership Forms and Web Page.


4+| Online Membership form (see <<Improve use of Business, technology and communication tools>>)



|====

==== Local economy initiatives

//NOTE from Pam - idea about working with LETS 2016-05-14

|====
| Action | Description	| Role	| Performance Measure

| Swap programmes
| The consumer economy is a double-edged sword, generally improving standards of living but at the same time deleting natural resources, using fossil fuels and often increasing household and personal debt. Creating a thriving barter and sharing culture is one strategy to keeping consumer products in circulation longer before they are committed to landfill or recycling.
| TTM will create a series of swapping initiatives based on previous experience. The first planned initiative is a clothes swap.
| Successfully plan, advertise and deliver regular swap events.

|====

==== COP21, Carbon Neutrality and Renewable Energy

|====
| Action | Description	| Role	| Performance Measure

| _Householder’s Guide to Achieving Carbon Neutrality_
| Produce and publish a description of how householders can achieve carbon neutrality including links to the useful resources
| TTM will initiate and lead the project and will publish the document on the TTM website
|

Successfully create and publish the document

Advertise this resource to householders

| Solar Panel Project
| Maroondah CC is planning a community Solar Panel Project aimed at low-income earners
| TTM will work with the Council to develop the project
| Designate a Core Group member to liase with the Council project team

| Devise a way for households to easily find how much energy they use
| Basically no one knows how much energy their household uses each year but the information is there on energy bills if only they could be easily converted to the same units and a convenient time period; this would allow users to see how they are progressing towards carbon neutrality both numerically and graphically
| Design and build a database and web interface for entry of household energy bill data which is then used to report energy usage
| Successful development, testing and launch of the project

|====

==== Sustainable Transportation

|====
| Action | Description	| Role	| Performance Measure

| Develop a TTM Sustainable Transport Manifesto
| Sustainable transport is critical to transport. However, transport budgets and legislation is tightly controlled by Government. Conducting large transportation projects in road and rail is beyond the ability and budget of TTM.
| TTM will create a manifesto that describes our long-term strategy for achieving sustainable transport in Maroondah. The document should recognise the impact of Peak Oil on society as well as Carbon emission on the environment. If possible, TTM will work with Maroondah CC.
| Document ratified by Maroondah City Council
|====

==== Improve use of Business, technology and communication tools

|====
| Action | Description	| Role	| Performance Measure

| Online membership forms
| Currently, membership managed by a combination of offline forms, Gmail contact groups and a Wordpress plugin. Currently we ask that Members either join in person or download a form and send it manually to the Core Group. This is very inefficient and is hampering member recruitment.
| TTM will look at consolidating this process, by creating a single member database with a single online form.
| Successful development, testing and launch of the project.

| Develop suite of project management processes
| A standard suite of project (and business) management processes and documents can greatly improve efficiency and consistency. By leveraging the web, database technology and automation, they can negate administrative grind and burnout. They can also help people with limited project management experience to undertake projects following guidelines and best-practice so they can concentrate less on administration and more on achieving their project.
| TTM will develop a formal suite of project management tools include: a project development process, proposal templates, project register and management plan templates. We will likely store much of it online to encourage openness and improve collaboration. The entire suite will be released under Creative Commons licence and any software created will be released under the GPL open source licence.
|

Develop, test and deliver the suite.

At least one major project to follow the process.

| Investigate use of collaboration platform
| Collaboration platforms make it easier for teams to communicate efficiently without having to meet face-to-face. Email however is not particular efficient for group collaboration.
| TTM will investigate the use of emerging cloud-based collaboration platforms designed to improve efficiency and work across desktop and mobile computing platforms.
|
