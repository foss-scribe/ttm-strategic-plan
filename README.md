## About Transition Town Maroondah ##


Transition Towns Maroondah Inc. (TTM) is an incorporated community group in Maroondah, a large municipality in the outer-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. There are two parts to our purpose:

1. to raise awareness about climate change, resource depletion and economic contraction; and
1. to initiate and support projects that help to create resilient and sustainable communities as a positive response to these challenges. We see localisation of the economy and our way of life, and re-skilling as keys to resilience and sustainability.
